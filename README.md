# Express.js RESTful API Assignment

This assignment focuses on building a RESTful API using Express.js, implementing proper routing, middleware, and error handling.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up an Express.js server  
2. Create RESTful API routes for a product resource  
3. Implement custom middleware for logging, authentication, and validation  
4. Add comprehensive error handling  
5. Develop advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search  

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation  
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom  
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

Run the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start

Requirements
Node.js (v18 or higher)

npm or yarn

üõçÔ∏è Product API Documentation (By Patience Ibitokun)
This is a simple RESTful API built with Express.js that allows you to manage products in memory. Authentication, routing, and error handling are included.

üîê Authentication
All routes under /api/products require an authorization header:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Authorization: Bearer secret-token
üì¶ API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/products	Get all products
GET	/api/products/:id	Get product by ID
POST	/api/products	Create a new product
PUT	/api/products/:id	Update a product
DELETE	/api/products/:id	Delete a product

üß™ How to Test the API (with curl or Postman)
‚úÖ Get All Products
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" http://localhost:3000/api/products
üîç Get Product by ID
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" http://localhost:3000/api/products/<product_id>
Replace <product_id> with a real product ID.

üÜï Add a New Product
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" \
  -d '{"name":"Tablet","description":"Android tablet","price":500}'
‚úèÔ∏è Update a Product
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/<product_id> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" \
  -d '{"price": 700, "inStock": false}'
üóëÔ∏è Delete a Product
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/products/<product_id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token"
